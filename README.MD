# SqlShrimp

## Description

- Sql is the first database that was introduced and that is highly used in companies to keep track of data ranging from products, employees, resources. 
- By implementing terminal inquirer's the user does not need to type a exact syntax for for SQL and they can focus on navigating and using the database.
- The main problems I faced is having the to access the databases with query's 

## Installation

Necessary npm packages: 
- mysql12
- console.table
- inquirer

## Usage
1. Need to access the SQL databases and make sure to run the command 'SOURCE schema.sql; ' to retrieve the tables.
2. In the same sql terminal the command 'SOURCE seeds.sql;' needs to be run to have the data. 
3. Return to the normal terminal run 'node index.js'
